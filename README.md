# Final-Project



------------------------------

##**Overview** 

Our project focuses on affordable housing voucher's strain on governmental assistance programs as rent prices for many across the US skyrocket. We will use data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) to establish the fair market price for 2 bedroom houses in 2017 and 2022 as this is the figure primarily used to establish amount of governmental assistance awarded, subtracting income based recipient payments. HUD describes fair housing prices idealy being below 30% of total household income, requireing that participants in either Section 8(general housing assistance) or Section 202(elderly housing assistance) pay a minimum 30% adjusted monthly income towards rent. The rest of rent is the responsibility of the HUD voucher program. Low income thresholds (those eligible for assistance) will be established, corresponding by county to determine the typical amount of rent paid by assistance recepients in that area for both years. 

Our hypothesis is while incomes have remained similar between years, rent prices have increased in many areas drastically putting significant strain on governmental assistance program to make the difference as recepients have a maximum threshold set by income. We aim to determine what the government payout difference is and use a machine learning model to determine clusters of areas with greater voucher payout increase as well as what factors have the most significant weight in this increase. The alternative hypothesis is there is no correlation between increased rent and government assistance program payout in 2017 and 2022. 

These years (2017 & 2022) were selected to examize rent increase in the wake of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As supply-chain issues insued, many jobs were lost or suspended for long periods of time, and temporary halt in residential evictions left landlords attempting to recoupe profit, rent in many areas of the United States have increased. A year before the onslought of the pandemic (2017) and the most recent data as the pandemics effect lessen (2022) were chosen for the best possible representation of changes. While our project will attempt to analyze the changes in governmental housing assistance programs, this is important to note as it is a major influence in the rent increase the HUD assistance programs will need to cover.

pre vs post pandemic has the strain on governmental programs to cover the gap in rent prices increased as rent prices have potentially increased as well.

##**Data Sources**

Our data was sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as it offers the most up to date information on fair market rents, section 8 & 202 housing vouchers, and guidelines for determining amount of assistance and qualification.
Additionally, this is the department that gathers information to advise changes in payout standards for the Housing Choice Voucher program. As a goverment run department, data from this source should be plentiful and contain minimal bias. 

------------------------------------
##**Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data**
- What is considered a fair market price to the HUD?
   - This will aid in establishing the baseline for HUD requirement for housing assistance voucher amounts, as it is their major contributing factor.
- What areas have had the most increase in housing voucher assistance payouts and rent between years?
  - This will establish areas where the strain on governmental assistance programs will be the highest.
  - Machine learning model will be used to establish clusters based on increase.
  - Information from these models will be used to draw conclusions about factors having most influence on increase.

##**Communication Protocols**
Primary communication will occur through designated slack channel, additional contacts have been shared for email and text communication if needed. A minimum of two team session will occur per week, with additional sessions as needed for progress completion. 
Pull requests will be reviewed and approved through another team member to ensure best practices and progression.
