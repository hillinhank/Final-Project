# Final-Project



##**Data Sources**

Our project focuses on affordable housing voucher programs effectiveness as rent prices for many across the US skyrocket. We will use data from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) to establish the fair market price for 1-4 bedroom houses, and use data on current rent pricing to see what percentage of housing cost would be covered by current vouchers. HUD describes fair housing prices idealy being below 30% of total household income, with no more than 50% of income. With this in mind we would like to compare the actual rent prices listed to established voucher amounts and quantify the number of recipients who fall within these thresholds. Additionally, information is available about current recipients rent in regards to 2022 

pre vs post pandemic has the strain on governmental programs to cover the gap in rent prices increased as rent prices have potentially increased as well.

Our data was sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as it offers the most up to date information on fair market rents, section 8 housing vouchers, and guidelines for determining amount of assistance and qualification.
Additionally, this is the department that gathers informatio to advise changes in payout standards for the Housing Choice Voucher program. As a goverment run department, data from this source should be plentiful and lack bias.
